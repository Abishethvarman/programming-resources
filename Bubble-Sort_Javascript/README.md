Definition
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm used to arrange elements in a specific order, typically ascending or descending. It's named "Bubble Sort" because smaller elements "bubble" to the top (beginning) of the array during each pass.

Explanation in Simple Terms
Bubble Sort works as follows:

Start at the beginning of the array.
Compare the first two elements. If the first element is greater than the second, swap them.
Move to the next pair of elements and repeat the comparison and swap if necessary.
Continue this process until you reach the end of the array. The largest element will have "bubbled up" to the last position.
Start again at the beginning of the array and repeat steps 2-4, but ignore the last element (since it's already sorted).
Continue this process, gradually reducing the number of elements to check, until the entire array is sorted. This process is repeated until no more swaps are needed in a pass.
It's essential to understand that Bubble Sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm, especially for large datasets, as it has a time complexity of O(n^2). However, it's a good algorithm for educational purposes and for small datasets.

Code-Related Explanation
Here's a more detailed breakdown of the Bubble Sort algorithm in JavaScript:

javascript

function bubbleSort(arr) {
  let n = arr.length; // Get the number of elements in the array
  let swapped; // A flag to keep track of whether a swap occurred

  do {
    swapped = false; // Reset the flag at the start of each pass

    for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      // Compare adjacent elements
      if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
        // If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them
        let temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
        arr[i + 1] = temp;
        swapped = true; // Set the swapped flag to true
      }
    }
  } while (swapped); // Repeat the process until no more swaps occur

  return arr; // Return the sorted array
}

// Example usage:
const unsortedArray = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90];
const sortedArray = bubbleSort(unsortedArray);
console.log(sortedArray);

In this code:

We have an array arr that we want to sort.
We use a do-while loop to continue the sorting process until no more swaps occur in a pass.
Inside the loop, we use a for loop to compare adjacent elements in the array.
If the current element is greater than the next element, we swap them using a temporary variable.
We set the swapped flag to true if any swaps occur during a pass.
The do-while loop continues until no swaps occur, which means the array is sorted.
The final sorted array is returned.

This algorithm sorts the array in-place, meaning it doesn't create a new array but instead rearranges the elements within the original array.
