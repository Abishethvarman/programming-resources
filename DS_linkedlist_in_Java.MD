## Definition

A LinkedList is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next one. It's a linear data structure that allows efficient insertion and deletion operations in comparison to arrays. In Java, there are two main types of LinkedLists: singly LinkedList and doubly LinkedList. In a singly LinkedList, each element (node) points to the next one, while in a doubly LinkedList, each node points to both the next and the previous elements.

## Explanation in Simple Terms

Think of a LinkedList as a chain of items. Each item (node) holds a value and a reference to the next item in the chain. It's like a linked list of train cars, where each car holds cargo and is connected to the next car. You can add or remove cars from the middle without disrupting the whole train. It's excellent for when you want to maintain a dynamic list of items.

## Code-Related Explanation

Here's a basic example of a singly LinkedList in Java:

```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    public Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

class LinkedList {
    Node head;

    public void add(int data) {
        Node newNode = new Node(data);
        if (head == null) {
            head = newNode;
        } else {
            Node current = head;
            while (current.next != null) {
                current = current.next;
            }
            current.next = newNode;
        }
    }
    
    public void display() {
        Node current = head;
        while (current != null) {
            System.out.print(current.data + " -> ");
            current = current.next;
        }
        System.out.println("null");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LinkedList list = new LinkedList();
        list.add(1);
        list.add(2);
        list.add(3);
        list.display(); // Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null
    }
}
