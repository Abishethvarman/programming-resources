JavaScript Data Structure: Queue

Definition
In computer science, a queue is a fundamental data structure used to store and manage a collection of elements. It follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, meaning the element that is added first will be the first to be removed.

Explanation in Simple Terms
Imagine a line at a bus stop. The first person to arrive gets on the bus first. When a new person comes, they stand at the end of the line. The bus picks up people from the front of the line, just like how a queue works in programming!

Code-Related Explanation
In JavaScript, you can implement a queue using an array or by creating a custom queue class. Here's a simple example using an array:

const queue = [];

// Enqueue (adding elements to the end of the queue)
queue.push('first');
queue.push('second');
queue.push('third');

// Dequeue (removing the first element from the queue)
const dequeuedElement = queue.shift();
console.log('Dequeued element:', dequeuedElement);
