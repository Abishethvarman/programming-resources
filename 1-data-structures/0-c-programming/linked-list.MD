# Linked Lists in C Programming

In C programming, a linked list is a data structure used to organize a collection of elements, where each element (node) contains both data and a reference (link) to the next element in the sequence. Linked lists are dynamic data structures, meaning they can grow or shrink as needed, making them versatile for various applications.

## Definition

A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence, forming a chain. The last node typically points to NULL to indicate the end of the list.

## Explanation in Simple Terms

Think of a linked list as a chain of connected nodes. Each node contains a piece of information and a pointer to the next node in the chain. It's like a train, where each carriage (node) is connected to the next one. This structure allows for easy insertion and removal of elements, making it useful in situations where the size of your data may change frequently.

## Basic Structure of a Linked List

A basic linked list structure consists of nodes, where each node contains two components:
- Data: The actual information you want to store in the list.
- Next: A reference (pointer) to the next node in the list.

```c
struct Node {
    int data;        // The data stored in the node
    struct Node* next;  // Pointer to the next node
};
```
