Definition
An array in Python is a collection of elements or values, each identified by an index or a key.

Explanation in Simple Terms
Imagine an array as a row of boxes, where each box holds a value. You can point to a box by saying its position, like the first box, second box, and so on. In Python, we start counting from 0, so the first box is box 0, the second is box 1, and so forth.

Code-Related Explanation
Creating an array in Python is easy. You put your values inside square brackets [], separated by commas. For example:

my_array = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

Here, my_array is an array that holds numbers.

To access a specific value in the array, you use its index:
print(my_array[2])  # This prints the third element, which is 30

You can modify an element in the array by assigning a new value to a specific index:
