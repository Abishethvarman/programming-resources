# Greedy Algorithm in Java

This README file provides an overview of the Greedy Algorithm and how to implement it in Java. 

## What is the Greedy Algorithm?

The Greedy Algorithm is a problem-solving strategy that makes the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum solution. It is especially useful for solving optimization problems where the goal is to find the best solution among a set of feasible solutions. The Greedy Algorithm is called "greedy" because it always chooses the best option at the current moment without considering the long-term consequences.

## Key Characteristics of Greedy Algorithms

- **Greedy Choice Property**: A Greedy Algorithm makes a series of choices, each of which is the best at the moment. This choice is based on a specific criterion.

- **Optimal Substructure**: The problem can be divided into smaller subproblems, and the optimal solution to the original problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems.

## Implementing a Greedy Algorithm in Java

Below is a simple example of implementing the Greedy Algorithm in Java to solve the classic "Coin Change" problem. Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, the goal is to find the minimum number of coins required to make up the target amount.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class GreedyCoinChange {

    public static int minCoins(int[] coins, int target) {
        Arrays.sort(coins);
        int count = 0;
        int index = coins.length - 1;

        while (target > 0) {
            if (index >= 0 && coins[index] <= target) {
                int numCoins = target / coins[index];
                count += numCoins;
                target -= numCoins * coins[index];
            }
            index--;
        }

        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] coins = {1, 5, 10, 25};
        int target = 63;
        int minimumCoins = minCoins(coins, target);
        System.out.println("Minimum coins needed: " + minimumCoins);
    }
}
```

In this example, we start by sorting the coin denominations in descending order. Then, we iterate through the denominations from the largest to the smallest, greedily choosing the largest coins that do not exceed the target amount. We keep track of the number of coins used and subtract their value from the target until the target amount becomes zero.

## When to Use Greedy Algorithms

Greedy Algorithms are suitable for problems where making a locally optimal choice at each step leads to a globally optimal solution. However, not all problems can be solved efficiently using greedy algorithms. Care must be taken to ensure that the greedy approach does not lead to suboptimal solutions.

Some common problems solved by greedy algorithms include:

- Minimum Spanning Tree (e.g., Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm)
- Huffman Coding
- Dijkstra's Shortest Path
- Job Scheduling (e.g., interval scheduling)

Before applying a greedy algorithm, it's crucial to analyze the problem and determine whether the greedy approach is appropriate.
