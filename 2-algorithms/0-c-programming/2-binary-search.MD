## Definition
Binary Search is an efficient search algorithm used in computer science and mathematics to find a specific element (target) within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, eliminating half of the remaining elements at each step. This process continues until the desired element is found or the search interval becomes empty.

## Explanation in Simple Terms
Think of Binary Search as looking for a word in a dictionary. Instead of starting from the beginning and flipping through each page, you open the dictionary in the middle. You check if the word you're looking for is on that page. If the word is there, great! If not, you decide whether the word should be in the first half or the second half of the dictionary, and you repeat the process with that half. You keep doing this until you find the word. This is much faster than searching one page at a time.

In programming, Binary Search is like dividing and conquering. You're repeatedly splitting the problem in half and deciding which half to continue searching in until you find what you're looking for.

Here's an example of how you can implement the Binary Search algorithm in C:

```bash
#include <stdio.h>

int binarySearch(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = size - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid; // Element found, return its index
        }

        if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1; // Target is in the right half
        } else {
            right = mid - 1; // Target is in the left half
        }
    }

    return -1; // Element not found
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16};
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    int target = 10;
    int result = binarySearch(arr, size, target);

    if (result != -1) {
        printf("Element found at index %d\n", result);
    } else {
        printf("Element not found in the array\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```
In this code:

- The binarySearch function takes a sorted array, its size, and a target element as input.
- It uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the search interval in half.
- The search interval is represented by the left and right variables, and the middle index is calculated as mid.
- If the element is found, its index is returned; otherwise, the search interval is adjusted based on whether the target is in the left or right half.

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm that can significantly reduce the number of comparisons when searching for an element in a sorted array.
